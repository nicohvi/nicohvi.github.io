So there's this thing called [SuperMemo](https://www.supermemo.com/english/smintro.htm), 
which is a program which is supposed to help you learn and memorize facts based on spaced
repetiton [^1]. Also their website is amazing. Seriously, check it out.

The program is essentially created by a guy called [Piotr Wozniak](https://www.supermemo.com/english/company/wozniak.htm),
whose dissertation for his doctoral degree revolved around how to use computers to
enhance learning [^2].

As it turns out he's also interested in sleep with regards to learning. Like,
[**really** interested](https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/sleep). 
In his 141 000 word tome on good sleep with countless references to all kinds of sleep studies, 
there's one formula that seems to be the cure-all for optimal sleep patterns (and thus optimal 
learning): **free running sleep**.

If you're feeling disinclined to read through all that information I'll condense it 
for you here. The formula is as follows:

  1.  Don't use an alarm clock. Just, don't.
  2.  Only go to sleep when you're **really** tired, not before or after.
  3.  If you can't fall asleep within 20 minutes, get up and do something else. 
  4.  Only wake up nautrally, this might mean you wake up at 4 AM or 12 PM, doesn't matter.

By studiously noting when you fall asleep and when you wake up (and if you take any naps),
the body should find a rhythm after a while, and you'll discover your **expected** bedtime,
as well as your **expected** wake up time. 

Now, the word *expected* is important because we're all biologically unqiue, and thus our
various expected bedtimes and wake up times are subjective. You might very well be more
biologically incline towards a 26 hour day rathern than a 24 hour one. 

"Sounds cool," you might think. "But how on earth are you supposed to manage that if you
have a job? I mean, I have to get up at 6 AM to to all the stuff I need to do, and the
only way to do that is by having an alarm clock."

You might very well be right. But when looking at this chart Dr. Wozniak posts in his
discussion of optimizing brain work time you might be inclined to think that it could
be worth it.

I know I can't perform 10 hours of brain work each day without getting burned out,
and given that this sleeping rhythm supposedly boosts creativity this could even mean that
your window of 4 hours of [deep work]() might even be enhanced. In my opinion this might
very well be worth it.

Which is why I'm going to try.

Over the next month (starting Tuesday October 18th and lasting until November 18th) I'm
going to try and adhere to Dr. Wozniak's formula for free running sleep to the best of
my ability. Well, there are a few caveats:

  1.  My employer requires me to attend work from at least 9 AM until 3 PM, so I need 
      to be avaiable for work within those hours.
  2.  I have a rather active social life, so I will occiasionally stray beyond my
      expected bedtime for other reasons than sleepiness.

It might very well be that these extranous factors are enough to derail the benfits of
free running sleep, but fuck it - I'm stil going to try.

To record my progress I've created a [sleep log page](/sleep) which will contain my
sleep log.

This might be the best and/or worst idea I've ever had.
