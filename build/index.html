My name is Nicolay, and I'm a developer who enjoys programming,
drawing, writing, and wearing dazzling shirts.
Preferably all at once.
</p>
<p>
I have a particular fondness for HTTPS, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Ruby.
When I feel like it I <a href="/blog/">write</a> about these things
and post it on the internet.
