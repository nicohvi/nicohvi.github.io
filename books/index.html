    I like reading things that smarter people have written
    because then I can present them as my own ideas at parties. For a complete
    list of all the books I've read and reviewed, you can check out my

    Below are my favourite books which I think absolutely everyone should read,
    because my opinion on the matter is obviously infallible.
