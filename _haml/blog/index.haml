    I sometimes have interesting thoughts, and at these increasingly
    rare occasions I wonder what they will look like once written down.
    This is the result of these moments.

  %hr
  
  %ul.posts
    \{% for post in site.posts %}
    %li
      %a(href="{{ post.url }}")
        %h2 {{ post.titleÂ }}
        %p.date {{ post.date | date: "%A %-d. %B %Y" }}
    \{% endfor %}
