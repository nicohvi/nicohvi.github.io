    %h3 Me
    
    %p 
      My name is Nicolay, and I'm a programmer. I didn't fully
      realise this until I was about 22 years old, but after
      my ephiphany I've devoted more than half of my waking hours
      to program computers to do my will, with varying success.

    %p 
      In 2013 I graduated from the Norwegian University of 
      Science and Technology with an M.Sc. in computer 
      science. During my studies I spent about 10 hours 
      weekly in extra-curricular activites (including being the 
      webmaster for a large-scale IT conference and being on the 
      board for a student festival). 
      Additionally I spent one year abroad, attending the computer
      science graduate program at the University of California,
      San Diego where I graduated with a GPA of 3.902.
