  %p  
    My name is Nicolay, and I'm a developer who enjoys programming,
    drawing, writing, and wearing dazzling shirts.
    Preferably all at once.
    
  %p
    I have a particular fondness for ruby, movies,
    <a href="/books/">books</a>, games, music (usually involving a guitar at some point) and philosophy.
    When I feel like it I <a href="/blog/">write</a> about these things 
    and post it on the internet.
    
  %p
    For some mind-bendingly incredible (and often abandoned)
    hobby projects, feel free to checkout (get it? Yeah, you got it) my <a href="https://github.com/nicohvi">github profile</a>.
  
  %p 
    You can totally take a look at my <a href="/public/resume.pdf">resum√©</a> as well, if that's your thing.
