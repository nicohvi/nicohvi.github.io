## Being creative aka stealing shit

So, I've taken the first, all-important step on my journey to learn how to create a game: I've successfully downloaded the **Unity** software (as well as the open-source implementation of C# - Mono - because Windows). 

Upon starting Unity for the first time, giddy as a child on christmas expecting to find a Playstation rather than woolen socks under the tree, I was struck by a massive case of information overload, from which I have yet to recover.

So, while I stumbled around in Unity's GUI, and wondering where the hell I would write my code, I decided to focus on the high concept parts of my game development process - i.e. **what did I want to make?**

Now, this turned out to be a harder question to answer than initially anticipated, and so I spent much of today googling around for inspiration. What I *do* know is that I want to make some sort of action RPG, so I had *some* filtering parameters.

Luckily I found some incredible games which I will shamelessly exploit as fountains of inspiration, and I'll list them here in no particular order.

### Bastion 
Holy shit this game is beautiful. The artwork alone is reason enough to praise this game, and I will definitively attempt to mimic (steal) their graphical style. Of course I do not expect anything I make to even remotely resemble this masterpiece, but it's nice to dream.

The isometric camera is also something I'm very interested in, more about that later.

### Don't Starve

I also really enjoy the design of this game, which seems to utilize a fully 3D world with 2D sprites, giving it a truly unique look. Again the combination of 2D/3D is something I find very interesting.

### Hyper Light Drifter

I think I watched the Kickstarter trailer at least 17 times today -  *ahmahgerd* it looks amazing. And **dat** soundtrack, which is apparently being made by [Disasterpeace](https://www.disasterpeace.com). This is more of a 2D, slightly isometric, take on the action RPG genre - also very interesting.

Anywho, that's the inspiration I got from today's googling, and at least I'm starting to envision what I *want* to create (although I've come no closer to actually being able to do so). Also I finally got rid of the paint spots on my ceiling today, *huzzah*!
