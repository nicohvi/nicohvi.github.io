teaser: Writing blog posts in jekyll using coffeescript, sass and haml. Much like a boss would.
intro: "
Creating a static website through Jekyll can be a blast, but it can also be a frustrating experience. On one hand, you can write your posts in markdown and upload them seamlessly to a hosting platform like Github Pages, but on the other hand you're limited in the sense that you're bound to use the tools that Jekyll support. Plugins can solve some of these headaches, but in the case of Github Pages those are out of the picture since they do notsupport the use of plugins. 
<p>
Certainly there are <a href='https://github.com/ixti/jekyll-assets'>solutions</a> to this problem, but it's always fun to solve things like this yourself. The following is a guide to how you can write blogposts in Jekyll using coffeescript, sass and haml. Because that shit is cool."
