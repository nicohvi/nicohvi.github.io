## Being creative aka stealing shit

So, I've taken the first, all-important step on my journey to learn how to create a game: I've successfully downloaded the **Unity** software (as well as the open-source implementation of C# - Mono - because Windows). 

Upon starting Unity for the first time, giddy as a child on christmas expecting to find a Playstation rather than woolen socks under the tree, I was struck by a massive case of information overload, from which I have yet to recover.

So, while I stumbled around in Unity's GUI, and wondering where the hell I would write my code, I decided to focus on the high concept parts of my game development process - i.e. **what do I want to make?**

Now, this turned out to be a harder question to answer than initially anticipated, and so I spent much of today googling around for inspiration. What I *do* know is that I want to make some sort of action RPG, so I had *some* filtering parameters.

Luckily I found some incredible games which I will shamelessly exploit as fountains of inspiration, and I'll list them here in no particular order.

Holy shit this game is beautiful. The artwork alone is reason enough to praise this game, and I will definitively attempt to mimic (steal) their graphical style. Of course I do not expect anything I make to even remotely resemble this masterpiece, but it's nice to dream.

The isometric camera is also something I'm very interested in, more about that later.

I really enjoy the design of this game, which seems to utilize a fully 3D world with 2D sprites, giving it a truly unique look. Again the combination of 2D/3D is something I find very interesting. Although the gameplay is interesting, it's not something I want to emulate.

I think I watched the Kickstarter trailer at least 17 times today -  *ahmahgerd* it looks amazing. And **dat** soundtrack, which is apparently being made by [Disasterpeace](https://www.disasterpeace.com). This is more of a standard 2D, slightly isometric, take on the action RPG genre - also very interesting.

The action RPG genre is something I'm very interested in (even more so after spending roughly 500 hours combined on *Demon's* and *Dark Souls*) and I found both the visual aspects as well as the gameplay mechanics of HPL highly inspirational.

Anywho, that's the inspiration I got from today's googling, and at least I'm starting to envision what I *want* to create (although I've come no closer to actually being able to do so). Although today was by no means a productive day, I finally got rid of the paint spots on my ceiling, so I've got that going for me.
