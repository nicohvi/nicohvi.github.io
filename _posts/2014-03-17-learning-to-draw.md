## Learning to draw

Bet you didn't see this one coming.

I've been doing a lot of coding lately (both work-related and otherwise), and
so I felt like a change of scenery. Programming is fun, but 8 hours a day is enough
for me at the moment - I mean, I haven't even developed carpal tunnel syndrome
yet, I'm a total programming n00b.

Drawing has always been appealing, but I've never given it a proper try before,
mainly due to the fact that I was busy learning things like coding and having
a life - by which I mean playing video games.

Another bonus for taking up drawing is that it also gives me the chance to show
off my pimpin' new 3000 NOK drawing tablet which I purchased spontaneously
after watching a YouTube video.

Anywho, after reading [this](https://medium.com/life-hacks/9f271b3ecf56) lovely
story on **medium** (about how to *stop* procrastinating), I decided to procrastinate
by finally whipping out my tablet (if you know what I mean) and drawing some
god damn doodles.

Check it, bitch.

As you can see, the farmer has come across a bear, and is none to pleased
about it all. The farmer's son (or *is* it his son - who knows? I do.) is
attempting to shoo the bear away using his arms, which I suppose might be a
good idea if his arms were made of guns. Unfortunately for him, I haven't
learned to draw guns yet.

Anyway, what has this got to do with game development? Nothing really,
it just allows me to get a new perspective on things. I do plan to, eventually,
create the art for my (hypothetical) game, but that's still a ways off - baby
steps and all that.

"Hey, it's stupid to try and do everything for your game - leave the art to
someone who actually knows what they're doing," my brain just said to itself.

Shut up, brain - you don't know what the fuck you're (metaphysically) talking
about. I mean, just this past saturday you thought it was a good idea to go to
sleep with a kebab on my chest.
