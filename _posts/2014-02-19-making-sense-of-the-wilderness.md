## Making sense of the wilderness

So the past couple of weeks were very intense work-wise, as I had to do a lot of travelling (and drinking, which my body has yet to forgive me for), and thus I didn't have a lot of time to devote to game creation (or, rather, the *thought* of eventual game creation). I have, however, been reading a *lot* of forum posts, stackoverflow posts, articles and Google+ posts (just kidding, no one reads those) about Unity and game development in general.

All my research has lead me to conclude that my approach using Unity is a sound first step, and that I should most definitively stick with it. Being a programmer I was skeptic to the whole **WYSIWYG** bloated editor, but hopefully I'll get past that and deep into some serious coding.

Anywho, not much has changed in the *actual* development department, other than the fact that I've decided that I most definitively want to create a 2D (perhaps isometric, who knows?) action RPG, heavily influenced by **Bastion** and **Hyper Light Drifter**.

I've also decided that in order to create the assets for my game (which will look like shit due to me being about as creative as the couch pillow I'm sitting on) I'm going to use another extremely complicated tool I've no experience with: [Blender](http://www.blenderproject.org).

The plan is to create simple 3D models in Blender (yeah, that should be no problem at all) and export them as sprite sheets to be utilized in Unity. Apparently this is how SuperGiant Games created the sprites for Bastion, so it should work for me as well, right? Right?
