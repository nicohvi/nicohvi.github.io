Rails is amazing. Not only does it let you utilise what is undoubtably the sexiest programming language on earth (name omitted due to obviousness) — it also lets you be productive in that language. Totes amaze.

If you’ve never heard the gospel according to Heinemayer Hansson I’m afraid this article isn’t for you. This is the first post in a series covering how I work with Ruby on Rails, and it assumes that you have some experience with Rails. If you do not, then there really are better ways to spend your time.

This series will tackle all kinds of subject matter: which programs I use to edit and test code; how I structure code running client-side; which gems I employ for solving common problems; which application servers I prefer (hint: It’s Passenger. Not the singer-songwriter, although he’s pretty cool as well.) and how I set them up with nginx/apache; which bear gifs I prefer to leave in as easter eggs — the list goes on.

  This is the preferred bear gif obviously

My approach is obviously just one of many, but it has always been my opinion that if you’ve found something that makes you happy you’re obligated to share it with the world.

Who knows, it just might work for someone else as well.

Anyway, I’ll kick the series of covering the sexiest topic of them all: testing.

## Getting off on the right foot

We’ve all been there: Snoozing 5 more minutes (actually make that 15), eating that last piece of chocolate cake (and hate your diabetes 2-ridden self afterwards) even if you literally have chocolate all over your face (don’t click that), put off writing the relevant test until you’ve completed that final finicky part of the controller action you’re working on — actually, you’ll test it sometime next week, when the weather’s nicer and the omens more favorable.

Dude, it’s okay. But also — dude, you can do better.

Writing tests is important, pretty much everyone agrees on that point (and if you don’t, odds are you’re not reading this) — but unless you’ve hard-wired your brain into writing them (by making a habit out of it) it’s hard to motivate yourself to actually write them, even if you know damn well how important they are. Why?

Well, unfortunately brains are assholes (no medical implications intended), and context switching is really hard. When you’re coding an exciting new feature (if you’re like me) you really want to keep going . Flow is easily induced while programming — “Hey man, I know Michael is bleeding from his ears, but he’s wired in so there’s no talking to him” — and not easily broken out of.

TDD is a good way to keep the context switching of testing and coding at a constant pace, but it requires a lot of discipline to maintain if you’re not pairing or a programming god.

If you should find yourself stranded in an ocean of code in a small skiff of tests, don’t feel too bad — everyone has sinned against writing good tests for their code. And there is always a way to get back to shore.

If you’re a regular mortal programmer, much like myself, a situation like this isn’t uncommon. A good way to avoid being stuck in the middle of my imaginary code ocean however, is to minimise the context switch between coding and testing. “But how?” you may ask aloud, attracting stares from co-workers for talking at your screen.

First of all, you need a good testing framework.

## Picking the right tools
I’m a big fan of rspec, it provides a lot of great short-hands, has many friends it plays well with and it avoids the verbose mess that is cucumber.

{% highlight gherkin %}
  Given /^the person "(.*?)" should not be "(*.?)"$/
{% endhighlight %}
