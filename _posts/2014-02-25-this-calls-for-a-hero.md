## This calls for a hero
After stumbling around in the confusing maze that is Unity in my spare time (which House of Cards and True Detective have laid much claim on recently) I decided that it was time to quit stalling on the sidelines, and start getting my hands dirty.

So after much ado I finally made my first shaky clicks inside the editor, and much to my amazement (and relief) nothing blew up. Surely and (very) slowly I made incremental progress on the basic aspects of creating a new project, and importing/creating assets which I wanted to use. In fact, everything was going so smoothly that I was sort of relieved when I ran into my first brick wall.

The particular wall in question was constructed around the question of *perspective*, and I don't mean that in a high-brow artistic kind of way, but purely technical - how many degrees would I need to turn my camera in order to create an *isometric* view (30&deg; on the x-axis, and 45&deg; on the y-axis as it turns out)? And additionally, how would I go about implementing movement for my dashing hero in said perspective?

Speaking of whom, I guess it's time to introduce our grand leading man. Though, since I'm still in the pre-stumbling phase where Blender is concerned ("One stumble at a time" has always been my personal motto), I have yet to create any sprites for my (eventual) game. Thus, my protagonist has taken on a rather crude and, hopefully, temporary form - in the shape of a sprite I found on the internet.

Not only do I have a smashing leading man for my amazing game, I've even got him moving around! So I will end this blog post with a bang by demonstrating this incredible example of innovative gameplay - I present to you: the first iteration of **Tim, Moving Around on a Square** (working title).
