## Hey, games are cool - right?

Was what I thought to myself today, during work. Now, don't get me wrong, making web sites with Ruby on Rails is
entirely my cup of `insert beverage of choice`, but deep down don't we all want to craft stories rather than
log in-systems? Slay (virtual) trolls instead of shaking our heads at XML configurations? Loot pimpin' gear from dungeons
rather than looking for an interesting article to read while your XSLT compiles? Braving vast cav... you get the point.

So, I did what any sane developer does when he's faced with a problem he doesn't know the answer to. After googling for a couple of minutes, and being overwhelmed with information, I decided that it might be smart to take this process step by step. First things first: *which platform do I want to develop for?*

Being a web developer I was very tempted to jump onto the whole HTML5-games bandwagon, but I thought that it was perhaps not the best way to go (seems to be a good approach for creating small, widely accessible games though). I mean, common, my epic adventure deserves its own application executable.

So after (finally) deciding that I would create games that run natively on my chosen platforms - rather than in a browser window - , I had to decide on what kind of frameworks (if any) I would utilize, and of course which languague I would use. 

Having had my shares of Java scares during my education, this was never really an option (JSP ruined me for life), and so my choice was (seemlingt) between C++ and C#, which both seemed like good candidates. The absolute best solution would be for me to make games using my beloved `ruby`, but who am I kidding?

After realising that since I have no clue about anything concerning game development, and that the process of creating a game is (probably) a rather complicated one, it became obvious that I would need all the help I could get. Enter Unity.
