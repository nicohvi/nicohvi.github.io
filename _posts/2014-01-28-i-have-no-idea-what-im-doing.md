## Hey, games are cool - right?

Was what I thought to myself today, during work. Now, don't get me wrong, making web sites with Ruby on Rails is
entirely my cup of `insert beverage of choice`, but deep down don't we all want to craft stories rather than
log in-systems? Slay (virtual) trolls instead of slaying XML configurations? Loot pimpin' gear from dungeons
rather than looking for an interesting article to read while your XSLT compiles? Braving vast cav... you get the point.

So I started googling around - what do I learn in order to be able to (very basically) create my own games? Well,
first of I had to decide which platform I would go for.
