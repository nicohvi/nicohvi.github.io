## Hey, games are cool - right?

Was what I thought to myself today, during work. Now, don't get me wrong, making web sites with Ruby on Rails is
entirely my cup of `insert beverage of choice`, but deep down don't we all want to craft stories rather than
log in-systems? Slay (virtual) trolls instead of slaying XML configurations? Loot pimpin' gear from dungeons
rather than looking for an interesting article to read while your XSLT compiles? Braving vast cav... you get the point.

So I started googling around - what do I learn in order to be able to (very basically) create my own games? Well, first of I had to decide which platform I would go for - being a web developer I was very tempted to jump onto the whole HTML5-games bandwagon, but I thought that it was perhaps not the best way to go (seems to be a good approach for creating small, widely accessible games though). I mean, common, my epic adventure deserves its own application executable.

So after (finally) deciding that I would create games that run natively on the platform, I had to decide on what kind of frameworks (if any) I would utilize, and of course which languague I would use. Having had my shares of Java scares in uni this was never really an option, and so my choice was truly between C++ and C#. After realising I'm a complete idiot, and that the process of creating a game is (probably) quite complicated, it became obvious that I would need all the help I could get.
