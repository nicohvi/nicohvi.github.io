    I sometimes have interesting thoughts, and at these increasingly
    rare occasions I wonder what they will look like once written down.
    This is the result of these moments.

  <ul class='posts'>
    {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href='{{ post.url }}'>
        <h2>{{ post.titleÂ }}</h2>
        <p class='date'>{{ post.date | date: "%A %-d. %B %Y" }}</p>
      </a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}

      I used to write posts on <b>Medium</b> before they unfortunately
      <a href="https://medium.com/the-story/collection-changes-part-3-d234638b3577">changed their
      policy on collection submissions</a> which made it
      nearly impossible for users with a small follower count to reach a larger
      audience.
    </p>

      I do have four Medium stories which garnered over 1000 views, so if you feel like it
      you can read those <a href="https://medium.com/@nicohvi">here</a>.
