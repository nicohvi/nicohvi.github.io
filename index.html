    My name is Nicolay, and I'm a developer who enjoys programming,
    drawing, writing, and wearing dazzling shirts.
    Preferably all at once.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a particular fondness for ruby, movies,
    <a href="/library/">books</a>, games, music (usually involving a guitar at some point) and philosophy.
    When I feel like it I <a href="/blog/">write</a> about these things
    and post it on the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    I currently work for <a href="http://bekk.no">BEKK Consulting</a> in Norway,
    which is pretty flippin' cool. If you want to get your mind blown by looking
    at some badass code feel free to checkout (get it? <b>GET IT?</b>) my <a href="https://github.com/nicohvi/">github profile</a>
    or take a gander at my <a href="/public/resume.pdf">resum√©</a>.
