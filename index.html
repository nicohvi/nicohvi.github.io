    My name is Nicolay, and I'm a developer who enjoys programming,
    drawing, writing, and wearing dazzling shirts.
    Preferably all at once.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a particular fondness for ruby, well-written <a href="/culture/">movies</a>,
    <a href="/culture/">books</a> and <a href="/culture/">games</a>, <a href="/culture/">good music</a>
    (usually involving a guitar) and <a href="/philosophy/">philosophy</a>.
    When I feel like it I <a href="/blog/">write</a>  about these things
    and post it on the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    I currently work for <a href="http://bekk.no">BEKK Consulting</a> in Norway,
    which is pretty flippin' cool.
