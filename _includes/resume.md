### Me
My name is Nicolay, and I'm a programmer. I didn't fully
realise this until I was about 22 years old, but after
my ephiphany I've devoted more than half of my waking hours
to program computers to do my will, with varying success.

In 2013 I graduated from the Norwegian University of Science
and Technology with an M.Sc. in computer science. During my
studies I spent about 10 hours weekly in extra-curricular
activites (including being the webmaster for a large-scale IT
conference and being on the board for a student festival). 
Additionally I spent one year abroad, attending the computer
science graduate program at the University of California,
San Diego where I graduated with a GPA of 3.902.
