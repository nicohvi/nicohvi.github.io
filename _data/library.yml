  desc:   Eckhart Tolle's teachings are a powerful way to 
          gain introspection into your core values, and how
          you feel about and interact with the world. I think 
          everyone will gain something by reading this book. Also, his 
          voice is absolutely hilarious so please, please get the
          audio book version. You're welcome.

- title:  The Antidote

  desc:   Oliver Burkeman takes it upon himself to demolish the sect of
          positive thinking (sounds like a depressing idea I know, but
          just run with it), and in the process covers topics like
          acceptance and stoicism with bravado. He's pretty interesting
          to follow on <a href="https://twitter.com/oliverburkeman">Twitter</a> as well.

- title:  The Tao of Pooh

  desc:   It feels good to just relax and enjoy the scenery for a
          while, something Winnie the Pooh was
          a real badass at. It's a good companion to The Antidote and
          The Power of Now.

  desc:   Fiction is important as well, and this book really
          struck a chord with me. It's a long (and sometimes slow)
          read, but in the end very much worth it. It still
          provides moments of inspiriation, several years after
          reading. Also it totally has magic in it.
