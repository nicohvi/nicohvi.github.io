- title:  The Power of Now

  desc:   Eckhart Tolle's teachings are a powerful way to 
          gain introspection into your core values, and how
          you feel about and interact with the world. I think 
          everyone will gain something by reading this book.

- title:  The Tao of Pooh

  desc:   It feels good to just relax and enjoy the scenery for a
          while, something apparently Winnie the Pooh was
          a real badass at.

- title:  Jonathan Strange & Mr Norell

  desc:   Fiction is important as well, and this book really
          struck a chord with me. It's a long (and sometimes slow)
          read, but in the end very much worth it. It still
          provides moments of inspiriation, several years after
          reading it.
