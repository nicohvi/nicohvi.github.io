- title:  Jonathan Strange & Mr Norell
  link:   https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14201.Jonathan_Strange_Mr_Norrell
  desc:   Jonathan Strange & Mr Norell builds its plot slowly
          and purposefully, and Susannah Clarke (the author) 
          manages to create a magical (in every sense of the word)
          world that somehow seems *real*. No small feat. This 
          book still, several years after reading it, provides
          moments of inspiriation.

  desc:   This playlist is the result of a four year long (and
          counting) collaboration between myself and one of my
          best friends. At the time of writing it contains the
          795 best songs in the world.

- title:  The Gone-Away World
  link:   https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3007704-the-gone-away-world
  desc:   This book is an exercise in creativity. The characters,
          the stories within stories and most of all the setting
          is so imaginative that your brain will either implode
          upon reading or generate such vivid imagery that 
          inspiriation will take on entirely new forms.

- title:  Spirited Away
  link:   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/
  desc:   The best movie ever made. If you want to experience
          the wonder you felt as a child - the fear of ghosts,
          or the awe of unknown experiences - then all
          you need to do is watch this movie.

- title:  Dark Souls
  link:   http://store.steampowered.com/app/211420/
  desc:   This game changed my life. The constant feeling of 
          struggle which eventually culminated in brief moments
          of pure ecstacy (before again falling back to struggle)
          are like no other I've ever experienced in any other form
          of culture. It taught me that if I wanted to
          create something worthwhile, I needed to work at it.
          Again and again. Additionally it showed me how
          well a story can be told without actually telling it.

- title:  The Tao of Pooh

  desc:   Things seem to be moving at an ever increasing pace.
          It feels good to just relax and enjoy the scenery for 
          a while, something this book really expands and reflects
          upon.

          world.
