- title:  Jonathan Strange & Mr Norell
  link:   https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14201.Jonathan_Strange_Mr_Norrell
  desc:   Jonathan Strange & Mr Norell builds its plot slowly
          and purposefully, and Susannah Clarke (the author) 
          manages to create a magical world, in every sense of the word,
          that somehow seems *real*. No small feat. This 
          book still, several years after reading it, provides
          moments of inspiriation.

- title:  Indie Heaven

  desc:   This playlist is the result of a four year long (and
          counting) collaboration between myself and a friend. 
          At the time of writing it has 795 songs, almost
          all of them containing guitar at some point. We're not very good at
          different genres.

- title:  Spirited Away
  link:   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/
  desc:   The best movie ever made. If you want to experience
          the wonder you felt as a child - the fear of ghosts,
          or the awe of unknown experiences - then all
          you need to do is watch this movie. Also it has
          a talking frog, which is pretty cool.

- title:  Dark Souls
  link:   http://store.steampowered.com/app/211420/
  desc:   According to my Playstation I have suffered the
          torment of Dark Souls for approximately 400 hours. 
          I suspect it may be lying. Regardless of the honesty,
          or lack thereof, of my living room console there is something
          truly *special* about Dark Souls. The constant feeling of 
          struggle which eventually culminates in brief moments of 
          pure ecstacy (before ultimately returning to struggle once more) 
          is a beautiful metaphor of the hardships of life, or whatever.

- title:  The Tao of Pooh

  desc:   It feels good to just relax and enjoy the scenery for a
          while, something apparently Winnie the Pooh was
          a real badass at.

- title:  Leave Before the Lights Come On

  desc:   In August, 2006 Alex Turner wrote the best song in the
          world.
