- title:  Jonathan Strange & Mr Norell
  link:   https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14201.Jonathan_Strange_Mr_Norrell
  desc:   Jonathan Strange & Mr Norell builds its plot slowly
          and purposefully, and Susannah Clarke (the author) 
          manages to create a magical (in every sense of the word)
          world that somehow seems *real*. No small feat. This 
          book still, several years after reading it, provides
          moments of inspiriation.

- title:  Indie Heaven
  link:   http://open.spotify.com/user/nico.hvi/playlist/5V4S6CWQdw1mkSXwhu2pBY
  desc:   This playlist is the result of a four year long (and
          counting) collaboration between myself and a friend. 
          At the time of writing it contains 795 songs, almost
          all of them containing guitar. We're not very good at
          different genres.

- title:  The Gone-Away World
  link:   https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3007704-the-gone-away-world
  desc:   This is probably the most imaginative book I've ever
          read. The characters, the stories within stories 
          and most of all the setting is so innovative that 
          your brain will either implode upon reading or generate 
          such vivid imagery that inspiriation will take on 
          entirely new forms. Also your dreams will be flippin'
          crazy for weeks.

- title:  Spirited Away
  link:   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/
  desc:   The best movie ever made. If you want to experience
          the wonder you felt as a child - the fear of ghosts,
          or the awe of unknown experiences - then all
          you need to do is watch this movie. Also it has
          a talking frog, which is pretty cool.

- title:  Dark Souls
  link:   http://store.steampowered.com/app/211420/
  desc:   According to my Playstation I have suffered the
          torment of Dark Souls for approximately 400 hours. 
          I suspect it may be lying. The constant feeling of  
          struggle which eventually culminates in brief moments
          of pure ecstacy (before ultimately returning
          to struggle) is a beautful image of the hardships of 
          life, or whatever.

- title:  The Tao of Pooh
  link:   https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48757.The_Tao_of_Pooh
  desc:   It feels good to just relax and enjoy the scenery for a
          while, something apparently Winnie the Pooh was
          a real badass at.

- title:  Leave Before the Lights Come On
  link:   http://open.spotify.com/track/6XhK6dMUBUHplp3n8WvgVf
  desc:   In August, 2006 Alex Turner wrote the best song in the
          world.
